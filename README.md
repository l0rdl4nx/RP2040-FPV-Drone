# RP2040-FPV-Drone 

A temporary snapshot of the firmware, PCB production files for the main board and 3D files for the frame of my DIY FPV drone using a RP2040 as the main processor. This includes rev1 and rev2 of the main programm.

## Firmware
### rev1
The first revision of the main code. Mainly to test out sensors and functionality. Written in Arduino IDE.
### rev2
The second (not final) revision of the main code. Used to test user interaction and more object oriented. Written in VS Code using PlatformIO.

## Hardware
### Gerber Production files
Production files for the main flight controller PCB. They can be viewed by any offline or online gerber viewer.

### Frame
An .step export of my frame-design done in CAD. The main frame was milled from carbon fiber plates using an online CNC service. Created in Autodesk Fusion 360.
